# Will the Customer Accept the Coupon?

## General Observations
* Drivers are more likely to accept **takeout** and **cheap restaurant** coupons. 
  Possibly because it's an easy impulse decision that will have a light impact on the walled.
  * Both are more likely to be accepted if the driver doesn't need to be anywhere urgent.
  * How often a driver gets takeout or visits a **cheap restaurant** are roughly equally likely to be accepted. Much more so than infrequent visitors of bars or expensive restaurants.
* Occupation doesn't seem to contribute consistently to any of the coupons.
* Nicer weather seems to only affect venues that are more social in nature, restaurants and bars.

## Recommendations

If there is a cost to offering coupons, one could focus on delivering coupons on
nice days and early afternoons and evenings when it comes to coupons for 
bars and restaurants, both cheap and expensive.

Takeout seems to be wildly successful, not sure if there should be a change there.
